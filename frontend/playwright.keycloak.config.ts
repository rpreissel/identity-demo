 * The login pages as Keycloak really serves them, in both themes (FreeMarker and Keycloakify,
 * docs/adr/ADR-041-keycloakify-neben-freemarker.md). Unlike playwright.config.ts this suite starts no
 * server: it needs the whole compose stack - Keycloak with both themes and the orchestrator that
 * switches between them - already running (`podman compose up -d`). Not part of CI for that reason.
 *
 * ORCHESTRATOR_URL / KEYCLOAK_URL point elsewhere; ADMIN_USER / ADMIN_PASSWORD are the demo's own
 * admin login (application.yml).
